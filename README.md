# Expense Tracker

### Description
This is an expense tracker application built collaboratively by Fayas (front-end) and Fawaz (back-end). The front-end uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for user interaction, while the back-end utilizes Node.js with MongoDB to store and manage data efficiently.

## Getting Started

### Frontend Setup
To get the frontend up and running, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the `front` directory.
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser.

### Backend Setup
For setting up the backend,
1. Ensure Node.js is installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the `back` directory in a terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to set up project dependencies.
4. Execute `node server.js` to start the server.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **HTML**: The structure of the application.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout through style.css and script.css.
- **JavaScript**: Interactivity and functionality for dynamic elements in index.html.

### Back-end
- **Node.js**: Runs the server and handles requests.
- **Express**: A web framework for Node.js to build a robust server structure.
- **MongoDB**: Stores and retrieves data efficiently, enabling persistent storage.

## Future Developments
Looking forward, we plan to enhance user authentication, implement more sophisticated error handling, and improve the UI/UX design based on user feedback. Continuous integration and deployment automation will also be set up for smoother updates and scalability.
